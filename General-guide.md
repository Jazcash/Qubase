# General code rules and guidelines

- Use double quotes `"` instead of single `'` quotes
- Indentation should use 4 character wide tabs, not spaces
- Keep everything lowercase where possible
- Only use element ids for selecting elements in JS
- Braces should stay on the same line as the opening selector, without a space inbetween `function hello(){`
- BEM nesting should only ever go one level deep. `block__element--modifier` is allowed.
