Explanation of the styles folder and what each file is and how it should be used

Use tabs for indentation, spaces for alignment
Braces should stay on the same line as the opening selector, without a space inbetween
Newlines should only be used for separation of contextually unrelated elements
BEM nesting should be used, but ideally should only ever go one level deep
Responsive websites should be developed in the same manner as they were designed. Mobile first or desktop first. I.e. using chrome's device preview mode first and above instead of below
Try to use flex for layouts instead of cols if it makes sense
When creating component files, the named hierarchy of the component should be noted at the top of the file
Never use floats. Ever.
Avoid using !important as much as possible
Z-indexes should be kept small. Try to stick to increments of 10
br should be used to separate content, within the context of its container. i.e. content is still related, but should be visibly spaced. In general, you probably don't need to use these
Don't use vendor prefixes, autoprefixer takes care of them
Use hex instead of RGB
To change the transparency of a colour, use rgba(#fff, 0.5)
Try to avoid using colours directly and use variables instead
Avoid animating layout properties like width, left, top and use transform instead
In general, an element's position/layout should be defined by its parent (e.g. using padding)
Order your scss in accordance with this CSScomb file:
Consult caniuse.com if unsure about an element or css property's browser support
Avoid passing specific values into breakpoints directly, use the breakpoint variable instead
Where possible, try to build components to be reusable inside and outside of the project
Avoid direct targetting of divs, spans, headings and try to use classes instead
If some text should look like a heading, but it doesn't make semantic sense for it to be one, use the heading classes
Avoid closing tags on single elements like input, meta, br, hr etc (see this list?)
